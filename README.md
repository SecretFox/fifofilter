# fifofilter
SWL mod that filters out some of the FadeIn/FadeOut messages  
**If you have used other mod that accomplishes the same thing you should delete fifo.swf from your Custom/flash folder**
Currently filtered messages:  
	* You have reached the maximum amount of X. You will need to spend some of this currency before you can earn any more.  
	* There are no valid targets in range.  
	* Interrupted!  
	* Cannot use this ability.  
	* The target is out of range.  
	* You have no line of sight to your target!  
These should work with all languages, if not let me know.
